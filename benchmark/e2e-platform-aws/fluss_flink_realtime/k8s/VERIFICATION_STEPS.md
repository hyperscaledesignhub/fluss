# Fluss + Flink Demo Verification Steps

## Prerequisites
- Kind cluster will be created automatically
- Docker must be running
- kubectl must be installed
- Maven must be installed (for building JAR)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

**Note:** All commands should be run from the workspace root: `/Users/vijayabhaskarv/IOT/FLUSS`

### Step 1: Deploy Fluss on Kind Cluster
This script will:
- Create a new Kind cluster
- Deploy Fluss coordinator and tablet servers
- Patch coordinator to use IPv4 addresses
- Wait for services to be ready

```bash
cd /Users/vijayabhaskarv/IOT/FLUSS/demos/demo/fluss_flink_realtime_demo
./run_kind_demo.sh
```

Or from workspace root:
```bash
cd demos/demo/fluss_flink_realtime_demo
./run_kind_demo.sh
```

**Expected output:**
- Kind cluster created
- Fluss pods running (coordinator-server-0, tablet-server-0, tablet-server-1, tablet-server-2)
- Coordinator patched to advertise IPv4 IP addresses
- Fluss accessible on localhost:9123

**Wait for:** All Fluss pods to be in `Running` state:
```bash
kubectl get pods
# Should show coordinator-server-0 and tablet-server-* pods as Running
```

---

### Step 2: Build and Deploy Producer + Flink Aggregator Jobs
This script will:
- Build the demo JAR (if needed)
- Build Docker image with all fixes
- Load image into Kind cluster
- Deploy producer and Flink aggregator as Kubernetes Jobs

```bash
cd /Users/vijayabhaskarv/IOT/FLUSS/demos/demo/fluss_flink_realtime_demo
./k8s/deploy_k8s_jobs.sh
```

Or from workspace root:
```bash
cd demos/demo/fluss_flink_realtime_demo
./k8s/deploy_k8s_jobs.sh
```

**Expected output:**
- JAR built successfully
- Docker image built
- Image loaded into Kind
- Producer job created
- Flink aggregator job created

---

### Step 3: Verify Everything is Running

#### Check Job Status
```bash
kubectl get jobs
# Should show:
# - fluss-producer: 1/1 completions
# - flink-aggregator: 1/1 completions (or Running)
```

#### Check Pod Status
```bash
kubectl get pods
# Should show:
# - fluss-producer-*: Running or Completed
# - flink-aggregator-*: Running
# - coordinator-server-0: Running
# - tablet-server-*: Running
```

#### Check Producer Logs
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=fluss-producer --tail=50 -f
```

**Expected output:**
- "Producer started"
- "Writing sensor data..."
- Statistics showing records written
- No IPv6 errors
- No connection errors

#### Check Flink Aggregator Logs
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=flink-aggregator --tail=50 -f
```

**Expected output:**
- "Flink Sensor Aggregation Job started"
- "Resolved coordinator-server-hs.default.svc.cluster.local to IPv4 via DNS: 10.244.x.x"
- Windowed aggregation results like:
  ```
  SensorAggregate{sensorId=sensor-000001, window=[2025-11-18T...], avgTemp=20.5, ...}
  ```
- No `InaccessibleObjectException` errors
- No `ClassNotFoundException` errors
- Job running continuously

---

### Step 4: Monitor Aggregation Results

Watch the Flink aggregator output:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=flink-aggregator -f | grep "SensorAggregate"
```

**Expected:** Continuous stream of aggregated sensor data with:
- Sensor IDs
- Time windows (1-minute intervals)
- Average temperature, humidity, pressure, battery
- Sensor status (ONLINE, OFFLINE, DEGRADED, MAINTENANCE)

---

### Step 5: Verify Fixes Applied

#### Check IPv4 Configuration
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=flink-aggregator | grep -i "ipv4\|resolved"
# Should show IPv4 resolution messages
```

#### Check Java Module Opens
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=flink-aggregator | grep "entrypoint"
# Should show: --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.time=ALL-UNNAMED
```

#### Check Coordinator Advertised Listeners
```bash
kubectl logs coordinator-server-0 | grep "advertised.listeners"
# Should show: advertised.listeners: CLIENT://10.244.x.x:9124 (IPv4 IP, not hostname)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If producer fails:
1. Check logs: `kubectl logs -l app=fluss-producer`
2. Check coordinator: `kubectl logs coordinator-server-0`
3. Verify coordinator is ready: `kubectl get pod coordinator-server-0`

### If Flink aggregator fails:
1. Check logs: `kubectl logs -l app=flink-aggregator`
2. Look for specific error messages
3. Verify all pods are running: `kubectl get pods`

### If you see IPv6 errors:
1. Verify coordinator patch: `kubectl get statefulset coordinator-server -o yaml | grep advertised`
2. Check entrypoint.sh has IPv4 properties
3. Restart coordinator: `kubectl delete pod coordinator-server-0`

### If you see ClassNotFoundException:
1. Rebuild JAR: `cd demos/demo/fluss_flink_realtime_demo && mvn -f pom.xml clean package`
2. Rebuild Docker image: `cd demos/demo/fluss_flink_realtime_demo && docker build -t fluss-demo:latest .`
3. Reload into Kind: `kind load docker-image fluss-demo:latest --name fluss-kind`
4. Redeploy jobs: `cd demos/demo/fluss_flink_realtime_demo && kubectl delete job fluss-producer flink-aggregator && ./k8s/deploy_k8s_jobs.sh`

---

## Cleanup

To stop and clean up everything:

```bash
# Delete Kubernetes jobs
kubectl delete job fluss-producer flink-aggregator

# Delete Kind cluster (this removes everything)
kind delete cluster --name fluss-kind
```

---

## Success Criteria

✅ All pods running without errors
✅ Producer writing data continuously
✅ Flink aggregator processing and outputting windowed aggregations
✅ No IPv6 connection errors
✅ No Java module access errors
✅ No missing class errors
✅ Aggregation results appearing every minute
