# Flink Job with Embedded JAR

This approach embeds the Flink job JAR directly in the Docker image, similar to the pattern used in `/Users/vijayabhaskarv/IOT/datapipeline-0/Flink-Benchmark/low_infra_flink/flink-load`.

## Workflow

1. **Build and Push Image**: The JAR is built and embedded in a Flink Docker image, then pushed to ECR
2. **Deploy Flink Cluster**: Flink JobManager and TaskManager use the custom image (which contains the JAR)
3. **Submit Job**: Use Flink CLI with `local://` path to reference the JAR in the image

## Files

- `Dockerfile.simple` - Dockerfile that embeds JAR in Flink image
- `build-and-push.sh` - Script to build JAR, create Docker image, and push to ECR
- `submit-job-local.sh` - Script to submit job using Flink CLI with `local://` path
- `flink-jobmanager.yaml` - Updated to use custom image
- `flink-taskmanager.yaml` - Updated to use custom image

## Usage

### 1. Build and Push Image

```bash
cd aws-deploy-fluss/low-infra/k8s/flink
./build-and-push.sh
```

This will:
- Build the JAR from `demos/demo/fluss_flink_realtime_demo`
- Create Docker image with JAR at `/opt/flink/usrlib/fluss-flink-realtime-demo.jar`
- Push to ECR: `343218179954.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fluss-demo:latest`

### 2. Deploy/Update Flink Cluster

The Flink deployments are already configured to use the custom image:

```bash
kubectl apply -f flink-jobmanager.yaml
kubectl apply -f flink-taskmanager.yaml
```

### 3. Submit Job

```bash
./submit-job-local.sh
```

This uses Flink CLI to submit the job with `local:///opt/flink/usrlib/fluss-flink-realtime-demo.jar`

## Benefits

- ✅ No manual JAR upload needed
- ✅ JAR is versioned with Docker image
- ✅ Cleaner than REST API approach
- ✅ Works with standard Flink deployments (no operator needed)
- ✅ JAR is always available in the cluster

## Differences from Operator Approach

- Uses standard Flink deployments (Deployment/StatefulSet) instead of FlinkDeployment CRD
- Job submission is manual via Flink CLI, not automatic
- More control over when jobs are submitted
